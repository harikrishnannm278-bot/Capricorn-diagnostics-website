        <h1>About Capricorn Diagnostics</h1>

        <p className="about-lead">
          Capricorn Diagnostics was founded in 1998 by Mr. Arunkumar Valore with a simple yet powerful vision — to bring reliable diagnostic solutions closer to healthcare providers.
What began as the distribution of J Mitra Rapid Test Kits soon became a trusted name in the diagnostic industry. Built on integrity, commitment, and strong customer relationships, the company steadily expanded its reach and reputation across the healthcare sector.
Through dedication and consistent performance, Capricorn Diagnostics grew from a regional rapid test distributor into an Authorised Distributor for Roche Diagnostics, one of the world’s leading healthcare and diagnostic brands.
